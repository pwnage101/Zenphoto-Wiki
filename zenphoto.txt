'''Zenphoto''' is a standalone [[Content Management System]] (CMS) for multimedia-focused websites supporting images, audio, and video. In addition, the Zenpage plugin (included) provides a way to integrate pages of information and news. Entire websites, including the Zenphoto website,<ref>[http://www.zenphoto.org www.zenphoto.org]. See footnote: "Website powered by Zenphoto"</ref> can be constructed with Zenphoto and Zenpage.

Zenphoto is an open-source community project and openly solicits contributions.<ref>http://www.zenphoto.org/pages/get-involved</ref><ref>[http://www.zenphoto.org/news/developer-coding-guidelines#subversion-svn Zenphoto SVN repository guidelines]</ref>

== History ==
Zenphoto was initially created by Tristan Harward in May 2005 after several articles were posted on weblogs citing the need for a better photo gallery solution. Development of the first version was driven by user comments on Harward's weblog at [http://www.trisweb.com/ www.trisweb.com] where a Zenphoto specification was published and revised. Zenphoto 0.8 was released on September 15, 2005.

In 2007 the community began development, adding many new features and bugfixes. Consequently, Zenphoto 1.1 was released in September 2007 and it has since been actively developed by the community.<ref>[http://www.zenphoto.org/pages/development Zenphoto development history]</ref>
