'''Zenphoto''' is a standalone [[Content Management System]] (CMS) for multimedia-focused websites. It features support for images, video and audio documents, and the Zenpage plugin (included) provides a fully integrated way to integrate pages of information and news. One may therefore run an entire website with Zenphoto.

== History ==
Zenphoto was initially created by Tristan Harward in May 2005 after several articles were posted on weblogs citing the need for a better photo gallery solution. Development of the first version moved swiftly and was driven by user comments on Harward's weblog at [http://www.trisweb.com/category/zenphoto www.trisweb.com]. Zenphoto 0.8 was released on September 15, 2005 and the project has since been in active development. It is an open-source community project and openly solicits contributions.<ref>http://www.zenphoto.org/pages/get-involved</ref>
