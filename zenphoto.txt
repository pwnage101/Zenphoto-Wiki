'''Zenphoto''' is a standalone [[Content Management System]] (CMS) for multimedia-focused websites supporting images, audio, and video. In addition, the Zenpage plugin (included) provides a way to integrate pages of information and news. Entire websites, including the Zenphoto website,<ref>[http://www.zenphoto.org www.zenphoto.org]. See footnote: "Website powered by Zenphoto"</ref> can be constructed with Zenphoto and Zenpage.

Zenphoto is an open-source community project and openly solicits contributions.<ref>http://www.zenphoto.org/pages/get-involved</ref>

== History ==

Zenphoto 0.8 was released on September 15, 2005 and the project has since been in active development.
